# Very Simple Calculator

I challenged myself to create a calculator in as little time as possible. This is very much just a simple
calculator made with React. There is nothing special about it. This was mostly a personal challenge to see
how much I have improved and how fast I could complete the task. Also, normally I would create more components than just the App component but I was timing myself.

All in all the challenge took me around 45 minutes, something I could have never done months ago.

Please feel free to open a pull request if you have advice for the code.
